# gm82room
This is a room editor module designed for Game Maker 8.2. It replaces the
builtin room editor with a much more powerful, modern implementation made in
Game Maker 8.2 itself. Requires saving projects as .gm82.

This is currently a work in progress! If you find any issues, hit me up in the
